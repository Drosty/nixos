# how to use this

Going to make this home-manager with a couple configurations. One for nixos with linux architecture and one with darwin for my Mac


## Rebuild Nix-OS
```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

## Rebuild Nixos home manager for mac osx
```
home-manager switch --flake .#ryandrost
```


## Rebuild Nixos home manager for nixos / linux
```
home-manager switch --flake .#ryan
```
